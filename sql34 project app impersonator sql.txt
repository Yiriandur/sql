/* PROJECT: APP IMPERSONATOR by YIRIANDUR

Assignment: 

Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

Now, what does the app's SQL look like?*/

/*CREATE a table to store the data.*/
CREATE TABLE article_editor (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    article_title TEXT,
    article_body TEXT,
    author_name TEXT,
    date TEXT);

/*INSERT a few example rows in the table.*/
INSERT INTO article_editor (article_title, article_body, author_name, date) 
    VALUES ("Yes", "This is an article.", "Yiri", "25 October 2016");
INSERT INTO article_editor (article_title, article_body, author_name, date) 
    VALUES ("It's the end of the world", "Or is it?", "Yiri", "26 October 2016");
INSERT INTO article_editor (article_title, article_body, author_name, date) 
    VALUES ("What happened yesterday?", "Actually, not much.", "Yiri", "29 October 2016");
